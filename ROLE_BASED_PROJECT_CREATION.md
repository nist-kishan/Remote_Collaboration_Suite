# Role-Based Project Creation - Backend & Frontend ✅

## 🎯 Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`backend/src/controllers/project.controller.js`)

#### Added Role-Based Permission Check
```javascript
// Check user role and permissions
let userRole = 'member';

// Check if user is owner
if (workspace.owner && workspace.owner.toString() === userId.toString()) {
  userRole = 'owner';
} else {
  // Check workspace members
  const member = workspace.members.find(
    m => m.user && m.user._id.toString() === userId.toString()
  );
  if (member) {
    userRole = member.role;
  }
}

// Check if user has permission to create projects
// Only owner, admin, member, hr, and mr can create projects
const allowedRoles = ['owner', 'admin', 'member', 'hr', 'mr'];
if (!allowedRoles.includes(userRole)) {
  throw new ApiError(403, "You don't have permission to create projects in this workspace");
}
```

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/utils/roleUtils.js`)

#### Role Permissions Matrix

| Role | canCreateProjects | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| Owner | ✅ | Full control |
| Admin | ✅ | Administrative access |
| Member | ✅ | Standard member |
| HR | ✅ | HR access |
| Manager (mr) | ✅ | Manager access |
| Employee | ❌ | Employee access |
| Team Rep (tr) | ❌ | Team representative |

## 🔐 Security Features

### Backend
- ✅ Role-based permission check
- ✅ Role extraction from workspace membership
- ✅ Specific allowed roles list
- ✅ 403 error for unauthorized users
- ✅ Workspace owner check

### Frontend
- ✅ Role-based button visibility
- ✅ Role-based button disabling
- ✅ Permission checking utility
- ✅ Consistent with backend permissions

## 🎯 Allowed Roles

### Can Create Projects
- ✅ Owner
- ✅ Admin
- ✅ Member

## 🧪 Testing

1. Login as different roles (owner, admin, member, hr, mr, employee, tr)
2. Try to create a project in workspace
3. Check if "Create Project" button is visible/disabled
4. Verify backend returns 403 for unauthorized users
5. Verify frontend shows appropriate error message

## ✨ Status: Complete

Backend and frontend are now synchronized for role-based project creation!

# Project Member Search - Restrict to Workspace Members ✅

## 🎯 Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/src/controllers/project.controller.js`)

#### Before
```javascript
// Search all users in the system (not just workspace members)
const availableMembers = await User.find({
  $and: [
    {
      $or: [
        { name: { $regex: q, $options: "i" } },
        { email: { $regex: q, $options: "i" } },
        { username: { $regex: q, $options: "i" } }
      ]
    },
    { _id: { $nin: existingMemberIds } },
    { isActive: true }
  ]
})
.select("name email username avatar")
.limit(10);
```

#### After
```javascript
// Get workspace members
const workspace = await Workspace.findById(project.workspace)
  .populate("members.user", "name email avatar");

if (!workspace) {
  throw new ApiError(404, "Workspace not found");
}

// Filter workspace members not already in project
const availableMembers = workspace.members
  .filter(member => 
    member.status === "active" && 
    !existingMemberIds.includes(member.user._id.toString()) &&
    (member.user.name.toLowerCase().includes(q.toLowerCase()) ||
     member.user.email.toLowerCase().includes(q.toLowerCase()))
  )
  .map(member => member.user)
  .slice(0, 10);
```

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Shows all users in the system
- ❌ Users outside workspace can be added
- ❌ Security risk

### After
- ✅ Shows only workspace members
- ✅ Users must be in workspace first
- ✅ Better security
- ✅ Proper workspace isolation

## 🎯 Logic Flow

1. Get project by ID
2. Get workspace from project
3. Populate workspace members
4. Filter workspace members:
   - Must be active
   - Not already in project
   - Matches search query (name or email)
5. Return filtered members

## ✨ Benefits

- **Security**: Only workspace members can be added
- **Isolation**: Workspace boundaries enforced
- **Consistency**: Matches workspace member management
- **User Experience**: Clearer workflow

## 🧪 Testing

1. Create a workspace
2. Add members to workspace
3. Create a project in workspace
4. Try to add members to project
5. Only workspace members should appear
6. Users not in workspace should not appear

## ✨ Status: Complete

Project member search now only shows workspace members!

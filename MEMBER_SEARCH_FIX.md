# Member Search Issue - Fixed ✅

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The API response structure was nested incorrectly. The issue was accessing `searchResults.data.members` instead of `searchResults.data.data.members`.

## 🔧 Root Cause

The backend API returns an `ApiResponse` object with this structure:
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  statusCode: 200,
  message: "Members found successfully",
  data: {
    members: [...]
  }
}
```

Since axios returns `response.data`, the actual structure is:
```javascript
searchResults.data = {
  success: true,
  statusCode: 200,
  message: "Members found successfully",
  data: {
    members: [...]
  }
}
```

So the members array is at `searchResults.data.data.members`, not `searchResults.data.members`.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Changed all references from:
- `searchResults?.data?.members` → `searchResults?.data?.data?.members`

## 📝 Changes Made

1. Updated member rendering condition
2. Updated empty state check
3. Updated no results check
4. Cleaned up debug console logs

## 🧪 Testing

1. Open a project
2. Go to Members tab

## ✨ Status: Fixed

The member search functionality is now working properly!
